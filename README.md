# Code-Samples

FANUC TP Sample:
While at the system integrator I created hundreds of TP scripts, usually between 10-100 lines of TP code. However, sometimes I had to implement some complex features. One example of this is was a dynamic picking routine which used vision and would have the robot pick multiple parts depending on their position and orientation on the incoming conveyor. I no longer have access to that code, as it belongs to the company, so here is a short TP program similar to the ones that I used to use.

C# Sample:
This code is for a personal game for my friends and I did not intended to share it with anyone while writing it. Therefore, the comments and naming styles were not chosen as carefully as I might do in production code. This was a recent 4 day project and is not completed.

C++ Sample:
The C++ example here was from a group project and is the combined effort of me and one other programmer who was already very experienced in C++. We both contributed equally to the code volume, but the style is a hybrid of both of our own. The difference in styles is mostly in naming - his is minimalistic (ex. variable named 'o' for offset) while mine is more verbose.

Python Sample:
This is one of my first Python programs and it was also a group effort. However, in this case my partner did not know any Python and we learned it together while writing this program. Since then, most of my Python scripts for work have been much less complex and are typically <30 lines of code.
